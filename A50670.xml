         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> Clergy-Man my ſelf: I have often debated in my thoughts, how I might lay out ſome part of that ſmall Tallent which God hath bleſſed me withall to do you Service. And calling to Mind, that Old ſaying, <hi>Ne Sutor ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Crepidam,</hi> I thought it would beſt become me to keep my ſelf within the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of my own Sphear, and ſo reſolved to preſent you with ſome little neceſſary Collection of the Law, relating to Clergy-Men, and having peruſed Sir <pb facs="tcp:93635:3"/> 
               <hi>John Dodderidge's</hi> little Treatiſe, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>A compleat Parſon</hi> Mr. <hi>Hughe's</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Law, and Sir <hi>Simon Degg's</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Counſellor, all relating to the Clergy, I found many things therein, ſo brief and intricate, that I thought it well worth my time, to inlarge and explain many of them, and to add ſeveral other matters which they have not touched, which I imagined would not only be delightſome to peruſe, but very beneficial to and worthy of the Clergy's knowledge: So I have taken their works in pieces, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a new Modell of my own, and out of their works, with ſome materials of my own, I have reared this ſmall New Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; I know it will not paſs without it's Cenſures, for thoſe Inconveniences which are not diſcernable upon the projecting of a Modell, are eaſily diſcovered and obvious to the Eye after the Houſe is built. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have called this Treatiſe, the <hi>Parſon's Monitor,</hi> yet I know to the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſort it will appear to be no ſuch thing. They perhaps knowing as much if not more then they will find in this Collection, and ſo cannot be meliorated thereby in their knowledge, yet to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallity of Clergy-Men, I hope it may <pb facs="tcp:93635:3"/> prove ſerviceable, and not without it's uſe alſo to the other, for though it bring nothing new to them, yet I preſume it mayprove <hi>Memoriae Amicus,</hi> by continue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe things that are in Memory, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traxing thoſe that are Elapſing, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieving the things that were vaniſhed. It is poſſible ſeveral Perſons, eſpecially thoſe who have known my Education, will look upon this undertaking as a great piece of preſumption in me, that I (who never had the Honour to aſſume any great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Title then a Practicer of the Common Law) ſhould publiſh this Treatiſe, when ſuch Learned Men in the Laws, as thoſe aforenamed have written upon the ſame Subject already; To ſuch Carpers my Anſwer is, I deſire they would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me before they hear me ſpeak, for if they pleaſe but to give themſelves the trouble to Peruſe this little Collection, though perhaps at the undertaking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they may propound to themſelves, that it will be time ill ſpent, yet when they have done, I hope they will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it time loſt, for although they have the Books aforementioned, and ſo think this uſeleſs, yet poſſibly this may ſerve as a kind of <hi>Paralipomenon</hi> to the others, for let me tell them, that they <pb facs="tcp:93635:4"/> will find ſeveral things inlarged here, with Additions of ſeveral other matters which are not touched there; for I have here brought in the <hi>Canons in force,</hi> the <hi>Articles of Religion,</hi> the <hi>Privilege</hi> of <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Church-yards,</hi> the <hi>Statu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes concerning Firſt Fruits, Tenths,</hi> and <hi>Mortuaries,</hi> the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation and Privilege of the Clergy there, and their menial Servants,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other matters which they will not meet with in the other <hi>Authors:</hi> but put the Caſe I had medled with nothing, but what they have taken notice of, yet the ſame Diſh dreſſed after another faſhion, often gives a freſh Appetite, and for my own part, I have found nothing more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightſome or gratefull to my Genius, then to reade the ſame Caſe, reported four or five times over in ſeveral Books for it is variety that makes a Feaſt. But ſome perhaps will ask why I have not ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing relating to Tythes, in Anſwer to which I ſay, that Sir <hi>Simon Degg</hi> hath taken ſuch pains therein, as little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more can or need be ſaid in that point, and beſides, every Parſon ſtudies more to be his own Monitor in thoſe things then in the particulars which I have here diſcourſed of, although there be ſeveral <pb facs="tcp:93635:4"/> digreſſions in this enſuing Treatiſe, which may ſeem Heterogeneall to the things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be diſcourſed of, yet they fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accidentally in my way, I hope the Candid Reader will rather Pardon then Condemn me for incerting them; for though at firſt they may appear perhaps Impolite, yet upon ſecond thoughts, they will not (I hope) be adjudged altogether Impertinent; my Intentions at the firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of this Collection were honeſt and good, and if the Book fail in the Effects, I wiſh that any of the Clergy would be ſo kind as to inform me, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I might be more ſerviceable to them, that I might manifeſt to the World, how ready and willing I am to be,</p>
